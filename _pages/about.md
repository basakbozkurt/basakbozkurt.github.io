Başak is a PhD student in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Institute, where she examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in fact-checking. Her research spans political communication, political psychology and human-AI interaction, focusing on how LLMs shape fact-checking practices. This includes exploring how professionals incorporate LLMs into their workflows, analysing the impact of chatbot-assisted fact-checking on users’ beliefs in misinformation and evaluating the effectiveness of LLM-driven interventions in curbing the spread of misinformation on social media.

Başak holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering, an M.A. in Political Science and an M.A. in Sociology.
