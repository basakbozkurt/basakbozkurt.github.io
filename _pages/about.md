## 📣 Participate in a Study on Fact-Checking and AI

We are conducting a research study at the **Oxford Internet Institute**, **University of Oxford**, to better understand how fact-checkers use artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, in their work.

### 🕒 What to Expect
- A **45-minute online interview** in English  
- Share your experiences and views on using AI in fact-checking  

### 🎯 Why Participate?
By participating, you will help us gain a deeper understanding of the current fact-checking landscape: its challenges, needs, and ongoing transformation. We hope the insights we gather will contribute to shaping future tools and systems that better support your work.

Participation is completely voluntary, and all responses will be kept confidential and
used only for research purposes.

👉 **Interested? [Sign up here](https://forms.office.com/e/CFx3KB5mzj)**

We will reach out by email to schedule the interview at a time that works best for you.

### 🎁 Compensation
As a token of appreciation, participants will receive a **compensation**.

If you would like, we would also be happy to share a summary of the findings
with you once the research is completed.
