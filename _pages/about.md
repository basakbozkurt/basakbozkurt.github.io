## 📣 Participate in a Study on Fact-Checking and AI

I’m conducting a research study at the **Oxford Internet Institute**, University of Oxford, to better understand how fact-checkers use artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, in their work.

### 🕒 What to Expect
- A **45-minute online interview** in English  
- Share your experiences and views on using AI in fact-checking  
- Completely voluntary and confidential  

### 🎯 Why Participate?
By taking part, you'll help us understand the current fact-checking landscape—its challenges, needs, and transformation. Your insights will help shape better tools and systems to support your work.

### 🎁 Compensation
As a token of appreciation, participants will receive a **small compensation**.
